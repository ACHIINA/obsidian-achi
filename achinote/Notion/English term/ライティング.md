It is widely argued that governments should mandate companies to adopt environmentally friendly technologies. I strongly agree with this viewpoint. The reason is that pressing global environmental issues, such as climate change and resource depletion, require collective and decisive action, and government intervention is essential in driving these necessary changes.

  

Some might argue that the primary responsibility of companies is to maximize profits, and that their pursuit of financial gain is justified within a capitalist framework. Indeed, it is true that businesses must focus on profitability to remain competitive, and imposing heavy environmental regulations might increase their costs. However, this argument overlooks the reality that environmental problems are irreversible and global in nature, and addressing them requires systemic and coordinated action. If left solely to individual companies, the scale and urgency of these issues will not be adequately addressed.

  

Historically, industrial growth has often led to severe environmental damage, as seen in countries like the UK and Japan during the industrial revolution. In those cases, the drive for profits resulted in pollution and public health issues, which ultimately required government intervention to regulate harmful practices and enforce cleaner technologies. This example clearly demonstrates that the private sector alone is not equipped to tackle such far-reaching problems. Therefore, governments must play a proactive role in setting policies that encourage businesses to innovate and implement sustainable solutions.

  

In conclusion, while the pursuit of profit is essential for businesses, the environmental challenges we face today cannot be solved by companies acting independently. It is the government窶冱 responsibility to intervene and create a framework that guides companies toward adopting eco-friendly technologies. By doing so, we can protect the environment for future generations and promote a more sustainable economic model.
